*(...)I knock at the stone’s front door.*

*“It’s only me, let me come in.*

*I don’t seek refuge for eternity.*

*I’m not unhappy.* 

*I’m not homeless.*

*My world is worth returning to.* 

*I’ll enter and exit empty-handed.* 

*And my proof I was there will be only words, which no one will believe.”*

*“You shall not enter,” says the stone.*

*“You lack the sense of taking part.*

*No other sense can make up for your missing sense of taking part.* 

*Even sight heightened to become all-seeing will do you no good without a sense of taking part.*

*You shall not enter, you have only a sense of what that sense should be,*

*only its seed, imagination.”(...)*
