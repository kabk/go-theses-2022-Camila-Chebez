							<p><em>‘Avalonia’</em></p> 

						<p><em>It was said that along the Ruhr a strange phenomena had taken place, an old sand-stone quarry had turned into a local climbing <strong>crag</strong><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. The possibility of rock only three hours away was enough of an incentive for me, together with a team of three, to go investigate. With a vague notion of coordinates given by word of mouth, we left behind the monotonous terrain of The Netherlands and into the undulating landscape of Germany. After driving past colossal open pits of coal extraction and the big smoky factories so typical of this industrialised area, we arrived with the last lights of the day to the small town of Herdecke. A blocking sign on the road made us do the last pitch to our destination by foot. Along the river we quietly observed the reserved fisherman in their patient game, an almost dystopian scene if you were to pay attention to the <strong>Baden Verboden</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
							role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> warning signs along the path, that indicated the risk of pollutants in the water.							
						</em></p>
						<p><em>In the dimming light of a retreating sun we discerned a small indication of a trail into the forest. And so up we went. In the seclusion of the trees and bushes, the darkness became deeper and the road noises dimmer as we slowly ascended. With every step our breath grew heavier and our eyes squinted in an attempt to adjust to the play of shadows. Like an apparition, we suddenly were in the presence of the cliff’s face. The sight guided our vision from our feet to its heights which, magnified by the night, didn't give any vestiges of an end. Framed by a low dry-stone wall it felt like we had arrived at an altar. We all gasped, unable to articulate with words what this discovery meant. Incredulous, we approached and laid our hands on the rocky surface. The coldness was a refreshing affirmation in the summer air.  Little did we know that underneath was lying the dormant spirit of a deep time story. This is the beginning of our lithical conversation.
						</em></p>
					</p>
					<br>

					<p>Surrounded by two highways and a power plant that runs as far back as the early 20th century (the TPP Herdecke H6), Avalonia's wild existence is an island apart from continental frameworks of value. Since it was part of an important mining area in the industrial era of Friedrich Harkort, the excavations in search of mineral resources are still evident where the bare skin of the land bursts open. These traces of human impact have given way to ‘holes’ carved into the hillside where now Katla and Avalonia cave stand. As if in mid-swing, the place was abandoned after most probably other quarries offered more and better profit. Left to the mercy of the elements, different species began to reclaim their place. 
						With an increasing population and the arrival of more industries, it become indispensable to have natural buffer zones in the region to counteract air pollution and provide an escape to the neighbouring inhabitants from their busy urban contexts. This drove the government to declare Avalonia a Natural Reserve. 
					</p>
					<p>	Working its strange magnetism, Avalonia drew the attention of an on-growing popular activity: that of rock climbing. This activity proposes a different way of reading the stone, where the features of its surface determine a certain sequence of movement to complete the climb. One could say that the role of the climber is to translate the visible and tactile characteristics of the logos of the stone into corporeal arrangements, where gravity determines the success or failure of the conversation. A lithic dancer himself, Daniel Pohl was among one of the earliest visitors, establishing routes and scouting the possibility of developing the ‘crag’. As he immersed himself in the activity, Daniel began envisioning the place as something more than just a recreational area, but an amphitheatre where the rock was the main spectacle. Along with the artist group of stone sculptors called Feinhieb, a series of ‘terraces and platforms’ were erected with the scattered slabs.This land-art-work acts as a base, a framework where the prominence of the natural rock is made evident, but also accessible for interaction. A bridge between the human and the non-human. An invitation. </p>

					  </figure>
					  <br>

					  <p>Avalonia is a crossroad, where the borders between human and natural,
						fictional and real blur. If one is to observe the interventions in the
						space, Daniel Pohl was successful in evoking an almost fantastical
						world, the gestures of his paths and towers functioning as triggers to
						the imagination for whoever found themselves navigating the forest.
						Turning ruins into playgrounds. His envisioned wonderland shares some
						qualities with Aldous Huxley’s utopian Island of <em>Pala</em><a
						href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
						role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. How much shall we give the rock
						credit for these narratives, this irresistible provocation they
						represent to the human mind in the craft of stories? Could it be perhaps
						that we see and hear the echo of epochs long extinguished that bid us to
						apprehend the world in more-than-human terms?</p>
						<p>Curiously, Avalonia happens to share names with a drifting
						microcontinent from the Paleozonic era. Perhaps in the shelter of its
						many caves, the land has started to dream itself anew, making its
						nomadic character stir once again. Avalonia, in its multifaceted nature,
						poses as a case of resistance towards what Bayo Akomolafe refers as
						<em>“the modern experiment of planting anthropocentric settlements and
						converting the commons into resources.”</em><a href="#fn4"
						class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
						When the stone is rendered as a mere mineral, it becomes subjected to
						mining and extraction. Perhaps it is the rock’s durability, the fact it
						prevails through time that has always drawn humans to a relentless
						attempt to master this noble material. Be it as tools and weapons
						–mortars, arrows and spearheads–, as a basic material for the
						construction of settlements, and also as a canvas for art expression
						–from the first cave paintings, to the carving of sculptures, to the
						beginnings of the written alphabet. The cradle of our civilizations was
						made of rock-hard stone. After centuries of manipulation and
						defiguration, can we look at its bare skin and read beyond its
						‘<em>usability</em>’?</p>

				<p><em>“This is the golden treasure of the Ruhr area.”</em> When
					introducing Avalonia the boulder club Ruhrtal <a href="#fn7"
					class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
					tries endowing the place with different immeasurable values. By
					presenting the rocky walls as a <em>‘mystical legacy of the industrial
					revolution’,</em> what is honoured in truth is the efforts of the
					quarrymen’s labour that entailed digging out the rocky skeleton of the
					land; and the countless hours invested later on by the artists who
					patiently reassemble its scattered pieces in the fashion of terraces and
					short walls. But what calls for attention is the following mention:
					<em>“Alongside these <strong>modern values</strong> there is something
					that is often forgotten, namely, a <strong>natural value</strong> that
					cannot be measured in hours worked or money - and that value is
					priceless. How shall we express in monetary terms the value of the owl
					that breeds in a nearby forest area and that sees Avalonia as a hunting
					ground?”</em></p>
					<p>To begin the story of Avalonia from the moment of its excavation
					would be like telling the story of The Americas from the moment
					Christopher Columbus arrived on its shores. Avalonia rested on these
					coordinates way before any human ran across it or even managed standing
					on their two feet. Against the immobility we can so easily assign to the
					atemporality of stones, this place holds within its name the keys to
					begin deconstructing certain anthropocentric suppositions. As mentioned
					before, Avalonia happens to be also the name given to a drifting
					microcontinent in the Paleozonic era. On its journey from the northern
					margin of Gondwana, the Rheic Ocean formed behind it, and the Iapetus
					Ocean shrank in front. It collided with the continents Baltica, then
					Laurentia, and finally with Gondwana, ending up in the interior of
					Pangea. When Pangea broke up, Avalonia´s remains were divided by the
					rift which became the Atlantic ocean, and many of its fragments are
					dispersed throughout Europe. <a href="#fn8"
					class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
					<p>Based on this notion one could speculate that what miners came in
						contact with in the outskirts of Herdecke was possibly a fragment of
						Avalonia, one of its many changing faces. Jan Zalasiewicz reflects upon
						the notion of a similar encounter with this ‘land-that-once-was’ on a
						pebble at the southern coast of Poland: “Landscapes are transient. This
						is a concept that does not come easily to us. In our brief lifetimes we
						see the Earth’s landmasses as things of massive permanence, the bedrock
						of passing civilizations.”<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
						id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Rocks move in non-human
						times. As a witness of epochs long extinguished Avalonia bid us to
						apprehend the world in other-than-human terms.</p>
						<p>In <em>Symbiotic Planet</em> Lynn Margulis points out <em>“One widely
						held unstated assumption is the great chain of being. It defines the
						venerable position of humans as the exact centre of the universe in the
						middle of the chain of being below God and above rock. This
						anthropocenic idea dominates religious thought, even that of those who
						claim to reject religion and to replace it with a scientific
						worldview.”</em><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
						role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> This paradigm becomes dubious when
						we are faced by a Nature that is, in the words of Bruno Latour, “no
						longer outside us but under our feet, and it shakes the ground. Climate
						mutation means that the question of the land on which we all stand has
						come back into focus”.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
						role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
						<p>Despite being excavated out of the ground, Avalonia is still buried
						under these human projections that prevent us from looking directly at
						its face. During the early 1900’s, Edmund Husserl founded a new
						philosophical study, <em>Phenomenology</em>. This study aimed not to
						explain the world, but describe it as it manifested and made itself
						evident to our awareness. It is by writing from the perspective of the
						experiencing body that Husserl can argue that it is only through our
						living spatial experience within earth that we can even perceive space.
						And it is only by means of our bodily perception of motion and rest that
						these actions have meaning and can be translated or recognized in other
						celestial bodies.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
						role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Aided by the perspective of the rock
						we will slowly descend from the hierarchical structures privileged by a
						post industrialised capitalism, into the shared plane where Avalonia
						dwells: at ground zero.</p>

						search of directions, we can barely discern Avalonia in the pale
						simulacra of pixels provided by our Google maps interface.The world
						seems to fit in the palm of our hands, and yet we can only be passive
						spectators to this stage that hosts our existences. This perception of
						the world witnessed from the outside, provided by satellite lenses, has
						been prepared by the quantifiable narratives asserted by Galileo
						Galilei, separating the objective from the subjective. Designed and
						trained by systems of ‘categorization’ and ‘recognition’ means that only
						a specific set of objects has been annotated and segmented while
						everything else has been deemed irrelevant. Therefore, each dataset can
						also be defined by its incompleteness. Avalonia, in all its complexity,
						is reduced to a set of coordinates: <em>‘51.402237, 7.408983’.</em></p>

						<p>If we are to follow the pull of gravity, the next great rocky body

						clock, we are only visitors on these hostile peaks.The reward of an
						‘elevated’ sight provided by mountain tops has brought ‘clarity’ to many
						minds. That, after the bodily trials they entailed, were granted with an
						extended vision; the gift of perspective. Such was the case of Alex von
						Humbolt, who conceived the ecosystem theory on top of Chimborazo
						mountain, during his excursion in 1802. As he climbed up, Humbolt
						associated vegetation zones according to their altitude. <em>“No one had
						ever come this high before, and no one had ever breathed such thin air.
						As he stood at the top of the world, looking down upon the mountain
						ranges folded beneath him, Humboldt began to see the world differently.

						connected, conceiving a bold new vision of nature that still influences

						<p>We may now see Avalonia by also acknowledging the surrounding hills
						and the Ruhr River whose very presence gives this place contour.Avalonia
						is not just a fixed point in space, but bleeds out to the other
						surrounding bodies. It is in constant exchange, like the raindrop that
						drips from its slopes and becomes infused with minerals, that then
						nurtures the river. The way of perceiving our surroundings as a network
						of relationships has been present in countless cosmologies for
						millennia. The main difference being that there is no discrimination
						between ‘things’ and ‘beings’. All matter is endowed with agency,
						animated. Incan cosmology views the land as the result of an intercourse
						of horizontal planes of affinities and vertical planes of hierarchy. The
						‘vertical’ representing mountains and ‘masculine energies’, and
						‘horizontal’ symbolising valleys and ‘feminine energies’, with the
						rivers as the glue binding both together.<a href="#fn15"
						class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> By
						attributing living faculties to natural phenomena, cosmologies are
						successful in making evident the indivisible roles of each agent in an
						ecosystem. A narrative of bodies intertwining, engulfing, crushing and
						embracing each other. The forces that create the organic: rocks, winds,
						and water are as integral as those which grow from the soil and drink
						from the stream. When we recognize these attributes in the ‘other’, a
						certain affinity takes place and our daily interactions become
						exchanges.</p>

						<p><em>“Maps obscure more than they reveal because their flatness is

						<p>Concealed in the depth of the forest, Avalonia’s evasive face forces
						us to meet it on its own ground. The steep path climatises our head as
						we make our way by foot. Our senses attune to the rhythms of birds
						chirping, of mice’s furtive steps, to the way the breeze makes the
						leaves dance. Now and then the sound of the railroad intrudes the place,
						and one can almost never escape the gaze of the colossal ivory chimney
						of the neighbouring power plant that rises above the wooden pillars of
						the trees. We turn a corner of piled rock and are suddenly greeted by
						the open mouth of the Avalonia cave. Engulfed by its dimension we almost
						can’t evoke its weight back when it was a simple drop pin on the palm of
						our hand. Being two-dimensional, the scalability of aerial overviews
						seem to eclipse the actual bodily processes of measurement and fieldwork
						which presuppose their production. Now that we have come closer,
						immersing ourselves under the canopy of trees, Avalonia reveals a depth
						we had lacked before.</p>

						<p>Nevertheless to stay in the visual realm is to stay from a safe
						distance. Our fingers itch to grab the phone and snap a picture. Oh to
						immortalise this encounter, to commodify it and have it easily
						accessible in the back of our pocket. In her work <em>How Not to Be
						Seen: A Fucking Didactic Educational .MOV File</em> Hito Steyerl’s
						examines the politics of visibility and the means for opting out of
						being represented in the digital age. In her video piece Steyerl warns
						us of the risks of being captured by the camera’s lens. <em>“The use of
						smartphones to document ourselves and others is implicitly aiding and
						abetting to monitoring systems through a regime of (mutual) self-control
						and visual self-disciplining, we feel the pressure to represent and be
						represented.”</em> The digital networks that visualise the world today
						serve to exploit the masses in the name of control, power, and profit.<a

						role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The Information Age is making us
						very good at symbolization, at the expense of bringing us into contact
						with that which we do not know and for which we have no categorization.
						The optical makes us perceive the stone in all its composition in the
						same way we would savour any painting or architecture. Again a
						relationship of subject-object. We cannot help but cast <em>Medusa’s
						curse</em>, rendering it a mere sculpture. To look into Avalonia cave is
						to stare back at an allegory. One of man crawling out of its depth after
						the promise of truer forms, towards the abstract realm of ideas:
						accessible for our minds but exclusionary towards our breathing bodies.
						But to enter this carnal cavern is to move away from a narrative of
						transcendence, and instead explore the condition of immanence that is to
						dwell entirely within another body. We step in.</p>

						<p>Within the shade our pupils expand, bringing the stone surface into
						sharp focus. The patterns and veins made by the layering of matter
						pressed on to matter, or the fusions and fissures caused by the
						pressures of volcanic temperatures, may pass as some kind of writing. In
						the eyes of geologists these scribbles do transcribe events from
						millions of years ago. However landscapes do not only move in time, but
						also through our perceptions as we move through them. <em>“Perception is
						a fold in the flesh of the world”.</em> Before his death in 1961 Maurice
						Merleau-Ponty was working on the notion of collective ‘Flesh’.<a
						href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
						role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> He calls attention to the obvious
						but overlooked fact that my hand is able to touch things only because my
						hand is itself a touchable thing, and thus is entirely a part of the
						tactile world that it explores. So how to engage with the landscape
						beyond merely observing it? We look down at our hands, and we notice
						them for the first time in this whole journey. Too busy looking at our
						phone, the very hands holding them acted as mere supports for this
						technology, unnoticed tripods. What happens when we give room for them
						to explore along our eyes? When laying our hands on the porous skin of
						the cave a whole new terrain starts unfolding beyond our eyes.</p>

							<figcaption>Illustrations from the book <strong>Theory of the Earth</strong> by James Hutton (1726-1797). Considered the father of modern geology, Hutton invented the term ‘deep time’ to talk about the endless cyclical process of rocks forming under the sea and being eroded once again to form new strata: ‘With no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end’. Next is a chart from the 1920s illustrating this process of rock-formation from an almost orthopaedic perspective portraining cuts in the tissue of the land for the viewer to inspect.

						<p>In his book <em>The Senses of Touch</em> Mark Patterson puts into
						evidence the enduring cultural assumption, present in Plato and
						compounded in the Enlightenment, of the primacy of vision:</p>
						
						<p><em>"In Aristotle’s famous hierarchy of the five senses in De Anima of
						c.350 BC, sight is the superior sense while touch is relegated to the
						lowest, basest position. Yet touch is crucial to embodied existence.(…)
						Being a singular sense that corresponds to no single organ,
						physiologically, touch is a modality resulting from the combined
						information of innumerable receptors and nerve endings concerned with
						pressure, temperature, pain and movement.But there is more to touch.
						(…)The immediacy of sensation is affirmatory and comforting, involving a
						mutual co-implication of one’s own body and another’s presence. On the
						other hand, touch can cement an empathic or affective bond, opening an
						entirely new channel of communication." </em><a href="#fn3"
						class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
					
						<p>With his essay Patterson calls for a remembering of the body. By
						exploring the rock with our touch we are rediscovering our own bodies.
						The sandy texture makes evident the softness of my palm, testing the
						strength of my muscles as this other surface becomes resistant to my
						push. Our touch makes the rock feel highly responsive and animated.</p>
						<p>To rediscover the sensorial attributes that we naturally inherit is
						to summon a renewed attentiveness to this perceptual dimension that
						underlines all our logics. Is to establish a sensorial empathy with the
						living that sustains us. In this manner, the void that gives shape to
						this cave is evidence of displaced and dismembered parts of the land,
						muted and spectral presences of a history of sharp picks and crumbling
						stones. A hundred years later we still encounter within the vicinity of
						Avalonia magnified cases where the plundering and despoilment across the
						face of the earth is perpetuated. <em>The Tagebau Hambach</em>, merely
						an hour away, is known for being the biggest coal extraction area in
						Europe. Lying on the site of the ancient <em>Hambach Forest</em>, in
						merely forty four years only 10% of its surface persists.<a href="#fn4"
						class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
						What are we imminently losing when we destroy the integrity of these
						non-human bodies that physically sustain our experience, in pursuit of
						monetary interests? When we begin to experience within our own lifetime
						the disappearance of places that took millions of years to manifest,
						it’s no surprise that many techno-optimists invest in technologies that
						could perhaps allow (a selected) fragment of humanity to escape to some
						other distant celestial body such as Mars. In the dark, a glimmer in the
						firmament will be the only reminder of this failed colony, Earth. A
						sterile museum archiving in its geology the wrongs of humankind.

						<p>Jeffrey Jerome Cohen proposes the concept of ‘Geophilia’ which
						entails <em>discovering through science and through art, the
						continuities between humans and stones, their congruence and
						co-inhabitance</em>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
						role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> In her <em>Study of Traces,</em>
						Wiktoria Wojciechowska creates imprints of natural elements on the body,
						ephemeral sculptures on the skin, coming from branches, leaves or grass,
						symbols of an entanglement with nature. The project Imprint - Sculptures
						uses stones collected in nature, as a catalyst for experiences; a
						project born from the cultural meanings and values of stones, the belief
						in their supernatural property, drawn on the geological transformations
						that bear witness to the Earth’s history. They match parts of the body,
						but remain raw enough not to impose themselves as a representation of
						the human body. By playing with relief, carving and polishing, these
						forms can be intuitively identified. The sculptures exist only through a
						physical interaction. They mobilise the passer-by, inviting them to do
						their own performance, like a ritual act that would cure them of their
						own ‘amnesia of nature’.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
						role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
						<p><em>Our thoughts are suddenly interrupted by a thrilled scream.
						Nearby we notice a group of people cheering after a guy as he attempts
						to move his way up the face of the cave. Contorning his body to keep
						himself close to the rock he laboriously advances. Breathing heavy he
						attempts his next move and is suddenly spitted out. He falls but the
						raised hands of his fellow companions guide him safely to a crush pad
						that swallows the impact. A few minutes later he is back at it. This
						time advancing a bit further. The others join him and jump from serious
						expression while exchanging <strong>beta</strong><a href="#fn7"
						class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> for
						resolving <strong>the crux</strong>,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
						id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> to bursts of joy when
						one of them makes it to a certain point in this seemingly invisible
						route they follow. Curious, we approach, tempted by the ecstatic
						expression this activity draws on their faces. And so we begin a
						different kind of journey across Avalonia, one in close contact to its
						porous skin.</em></p>

					   <p>Rock climbing intermingles in its act the optical with the haptic. As
						an embodying practice it literally adds the concrete experience of hands
						and feet to the abstracted reading of the rock’s surface. As we run our
						fingers, we hold on to the small cracks and indentations. Once we secure
						them, we engage our muscles and we take off from the ground. The pull of
						gravity propels us back to our bodies, senses are sharpened, and we
						suddenly become aware of every feature and every lichen clinging like us
						to the porous surface. The morphology of the rocks becomes a manual for
						the body. An upside-down grip suggests an under-cling, a small hole is a
						perfect pocket rest, etc. The stone takes us by the hand and teaches us
						to walk again in this new plane. Before we know it, we are dancing the
						choreography of the rock. If we are to look at the traces of chalk on
						the wall we may appreciate a new story about the relationship between
						hand and stone, one of mobility and mutual effect. My hand is not only
						leaving its imprint on the rock but if you look at my own hand’s
						calluses the rock has left its marks on me.</p>

						<p>A very particular phenomena happens when people interact with rock, a
						playfulness innate in all of us is triggered. When creating stages for
						climbers to learn and connect with nature Daniel Pohl claims:
						<em>“That’s what is important about bouldering<a href="#fn1"
						class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
						role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>,that we teach the adults how to be
						kids again.”</em><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
						role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>When climbing we, for a moment, allow
						ourselves to be guided by the rules predetermined by the stone’s
						morphology. Countless are the ways of climbing the face of a rock, as
						<em>‘knowing another is endless’</em><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
						id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, for such is the nature
						of imagination. The multitude of ways range in difficulty, each
						demanding a higher or lower level of performance. We accept the physical
						challenge of this other body, and after each failed attempt we start
						archiving a muscle memory of the way the stone ‘wants’ to be touched. In
						this activity reaching the ‘heights’ is not entirely the goal, but
						managing to perform the many ‘ways’ of doing so. In his <em>Homo
						ludens</em> research, Johan Huizinga, poses the key function of playing
						in culture, as a characteristic feature of humans:<a href="#fn4"
						class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
						<p><em>“(…)In this intensity, this absorption, this power of maddening,
						lies the very essence, the primordial quality of play. Nature, so our
						reasoning mind tells us, could just as easily have given her children
						all those useful functions of discharging superabundant energy, of
						relaxing after exertion, of training for the demands of life, of
						compensating for unfulfilled longings, etc., in the form of purely
						mechanical exercises and reactions. But no, she gave us play, with its
						tension, its mirth, and its fun.”</em></p>
						<p>David Abram points out in his book <em>The Spell of the Sensuous</em>
						that through its classification logic and quantifiable formulas science
						has a lot of time <em>“ended destroying the integrity of their study
						subject, far from coming to know it completely, it has simply wrecked
						any possibility of coming to know it further, having traded the
						relationship between oneself and the subject for a collection of
						fragments.”</em> <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
						role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>In a time in which our current living
						patterns are reaching their limits, more than ever we must attend to the
						astonishing dissociation. Play coming from an irrational impulse, an
						activity that infuses us with joy, allows us to break away from
						modernity’s disenchantment. What would happen if we allow our instincts
						to become restorative passions? If we could turn this burst of joy
						stirred by other non-human bodies into creative practices that could
						parallely reconstruct and enhance the healing of landscapes? This
						natural instinct we conceal, may help us wake up from our paralysis and
						stir our involvement.</p>
						<p>During October of 2021 I had the opportunity to participate in a
						workshop of Mexican artist Amanda Piña<a href="#fn6"
						class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. As
						a feminine and decolonial ecosomatic proposal, this workshop/laboratory
						proposes the practice and reappearance of dance structures of
						<em>Masewal</em> origin that facilitate the action of becoming a
						mountain, as well as the application of practises of somatic origin that
						facilitate the transformation of the body in movement. The work proposes
						understanding and experiencing the body as an earth place, relational on
						multiple scales, from the micro to the macro. A body that is part of
						other bodies: city, sea, mountain, glacier, lake, river, estuary,
						continental, planetary and cosmic body. A body made up in turn by other
						bodies: anatomical structures, bodies that make up the microbiota
						(bacteria, viruses and microbes), cellular, atomic, subatomic, subtle
						and immaterial bodies. Dance is here not understood only as a form of
						expression but as an ancient way of knowing through identification, in
						this sense all practices shared in the workshop have the aim at
						establishing a close relation with other living beings as bodies, bodies
						of mountains, glaciers, water and earth.</p>
						<p>This manner of heightening our senses and opening ourselves to these
						other non-human voices is mentioned by Simon O’Sullivan in his essay The
						Aesthetics of Affect, in which he refers to the nature of ‘affect’ as
						“that which connects us to the world. It is the matter in us responding
						and resonating with the matter around us.”<a href="#fn7"
						class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> In
						this manner the function of art is reinterpreted not as a way of
						representation but as a ‘portal’, it seeks to “place us in a space at
						the limits of the sacred, and asks us not to contemplate images but to
						communicate with beings.”When we come into contact and climb we are
						lending our bodies for the rock to articulate. In this “Avalonian
						piece”, the stone becomes the orchestrator, us the players, our bodies
						the instruments and the route the score that sets the music in motion.
						As J.F. Lyotard highlights in his book <em>The Postmodern Condition: A
						Report on Knowledge:</em> “Art is less involved in making sense of the
						world and more involved in exploring the possibilities of being, of
						becoming, in the world. Less involved in knowledge and more involved in
						experience, in pushing forward the boundaries of what can be
						experienced. Finally, less involved in shielding us from death, but
						indeed precisely involved in actualising the possibilities of life.”<a

					   <p>We have reached <em>Nadir</em>, the lowest point. In these depths, we
						have been rewarded not by a golden treasure, but by an uncanny gift of
						perspective. The land rests under our feet, around and above our heads:
						our sense of proportion, restored yet deepened. As we made our way here,
						the stone allowed us to see past the veil of exceptionalism, inviting us
						to explore the technologies of our senses, repainting the blueprint of
						our planet into an Earth far richer in details and colours. As designers
						and creators, we are posed with the challenge of devising new metaphors
						to face and navigate through these unique exceptional situations caused
						by a mutating climate, to comprehend the world on its dynamic
						becoming.</p>
						<p>In order to escape the monocular stare where the viewer experiences
						an apparent mastery of the visible world, rock climbing offers a close
						interaction and a phenomenological and memory-based perception of space.
						By tuning the instrument of our senses into the finer details of these
						lithic song lines, we encounter what David Abram beautifully refers to
						as <em>“an inexhaustible depth of forms composed of layers upon layers
						of earlier rhythms.”</em> (Abram, 1996, pp. 64) By engaging our bodies
						we ‘vocalise’ a (temporary) fragment of these narratives The unfolding
						agency of this activity turns it into a potential tool of mapping, a
						means to make evident these more-than-human relationships and
						encounters, the correlations, networks and crossroads.The output becomes
						an ever-changing process of building and growing, instead of a
						universalised representation of a fixed reality. To climb is to
						construct a collective imagery of a place, one conceived by the ability
						to <em>‘actuate territories’</em>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
						id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> a process of bringing
						space into being.</p>
						<p>Encompassed by its porous body, Avalonia’s spirit permeates. As our
						own bodies traverse the rock we learn to love the particularities of
						each corrugation, the strangeness so distinct to this sandy surface, so
						different yet so irresistible to our tender skin. Each sector in
						Avalonia is incomparable in its uniqueness, its precious and inimitable
						place in the world. We are inscribing in our muscle memory the memory of
						the stone. We have been taught how to move in its ways and cling on to
						its matter, and we cannot help but be changed in the process of
						interacting. Climbing allows us to bend our perception, making us able
						to empathise with that which is ‘other’, such as the body of rocks. When
						we trust our bodies and the rock to take us through this process of
						oscillation, between pulling away and coming closer again, we are
						capable of becoming an object with and for the world, and return to
						being a subject in the world. This makes stone, in all its metamorphic
						states and scales not only a passive canvas foreshadowing the insatiable
						human passion for meaning and recording, but an active agent with its
						tectonic-like rhythms that challenges our very feet and senses into a
						different dance with the cosmos.</p>
