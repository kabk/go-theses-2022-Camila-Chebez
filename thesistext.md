**Avalonia, a place that conceals under its canopy the remains of a sandstone quarry in the Ruhr area, beckons for a closer look into its depths. In this existing capitalist ruin how can we transform a solely human value into an intrinsic value of things, of stone? This essay intends to be a physical endeavour as much as a thought experiment, a journey into proximity with the layered history of Avalonia. Aided by the perspective of the rock we will slowly descend from the outer-space satellites we have become, forwards into the shared plane where Avalonia dwells, that which nurtures our bodies and that physically sustains our experience. By using the act of rock climbing, an activity that intermingles the optical with the haptic, we will devise a new form of coming into contact with these more-than-human bodies. By immersing ourselves in the choreography of the rock, realities previously unseen or unimagined are uncovered, even across this seemingly ‘exhausted’ ground.**
