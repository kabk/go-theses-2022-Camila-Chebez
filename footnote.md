Surrounded by two highways and a power plant that runs as far back as the early 20th century (the TPP Herdecke H6), Avalonia's wild existence is an island apart from continental frameworks of value. Since it was part of an important mining area in the industrial era of Friedrich Harkort, the excavations in search of mineral resources are still evident where the bare skin of the land bursts open. These traces of human impact have given way to ‘holes’ carved into the hillside where now Katla and Avalonia cave stand. As if in mid-swing, the place was abandoned after most probably other queries offered more and better profit. Left to the mercy of the elements, different species began to reclaim their place. With an increasingly growing population and the arrival of more industry, the need of natural buffer zones in the region[^1] to counteract air pollution and provide an escape to the neighbouring inhabitants from their busy urban every-day-contexts drove the government to declare it a Natural Reserve.
